Welcome to the repo for the [Realm](https://realm.io) Mobile Challenge.

Before completing the challenge, you will need to create a [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) database Cluster and import a [MongoDB Realm application](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/realm-mobile-challenge/tree/main/Realm-Backend). After setting up that application backend, you need to add the Realm app's ID to the code for either the iOS or Android mobile apps and then build and run that mobile app.

You can find details for setting up the backend Realm and mobile apps in the sub-directories of this repo:
- [Realm Backend](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/realm-mobile-challenge/tree/main/Realm-Backend)
- [iOS app](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/realm-mobile-challenge/tree/main/iOS)
- [Android app](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/realm-mobile-challenge/tree/main/Android) - *to be added*

The challenge app is based on the [RChat](https://github.com/realm/RChat) Realm app.

Read about the [RChat data architecture here](https://developer.mongodb.com/how-to/realm-swiftui-ios-chat-app) and [how the app was built here](https://developer.mongodb.com/how-to/building-a-mobile-chat-app-using-realm-new-way/).

You [enter the challenge here???](https://realm.io).
